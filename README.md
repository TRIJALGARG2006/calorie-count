# 🥗 Kcal Tracker

A simple **Python-based calorie tracking program** that allows users to log their meals, record the calories for each food item, and view a **tabular summary** of their daily calorie intake.

## 📜 Features

- Log multiple meals in a day.  
- Add multiple food items under each meal.  
- Automatically records the time when a meal is logged.  
- Displays a clean, tabular summary of all meals and total calories.  
- Input validation to ensure only valid numbers are entered for counts and calories.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The program first asks how many meals you want to log.  
2. For each meal:
   - You enter a meal name (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).
   - The current time is recorded automatically.
   - You specify how many food items were in that meal.
   - For each item, you provide its name and calorie count.
3. After all meals are entered, the program prints a **formatted summary table** with:
   - Time of meal  
   - Meal name  
   - Total calories per meal  
   - Grand total calories of the day
